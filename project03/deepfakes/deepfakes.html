        <!-- Introductory paragraph -->
        <p>
            Deepfake technology is rooted in deep learning, an AI technique that trains models to recognize 
            and replicate patterns based on vast amounts of data. This page will dive deeper into that technology 
            along with how it effects the media.

        <h2>More about deepfakes in media</h2>

        <!-- Explanation of the types of deepfakes -->
        <p>
            This technology can be categorized into four main types: identity swap, face reenactment, attribute manipulation, and entire face synthesis. Identity swap 
            involves replacing one person's face with another’s. This is a common form of deepfake seen across various media. Face reenactment involves replacing a person’s 
            facial expressions with those of someone else. Attribute manipulation involves altering features such as hair or skin color, often seen in social media filters. 
            Finally, entire face synthesis generates entirely new, synthetic faces that do not belong to real people. These descriptions were sourced from Zahid Akhtar's 2024 
            article in the National Center for Biotechnology Information. 
        </p>

        <!-- Discussion of ethical concerns and possible benefits -->
        <p>
            Deepfake technology can be harnessed for creative purposes, such as enriching media and communication. While there are valid concerns regarding its misuse, there 
            is also room for responsible use of this technology in entertainment, education, and even medicine. The key is to ensure proper governance and regulation to mitigate 
            the risks while allowing the technology to flourish in positive ways.
