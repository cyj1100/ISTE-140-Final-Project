        <!-- Introductory paragraph -->
        <p>
            Deepfakes are increasingly being used and distributed online, with a range of ethical and legal implications. Surprisingly, the majority of deepfakes online 
            are pornographic in nature, and many are produced without consent.

        <h2>More about the law and deep fakes</h2>

        <!-- Supporting paragraph with factual details and source reference -->
        <p>
            According to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression in their 2024 article, deep learning enables an AI model to reconstruct images, video, or 
            audio by identifying specific traits like voice or appearance. When trained on a person’s image or voice, these models can create incredibly realistic 
            depictions of them. Given this potential, deepfake technology presents both opportunities and challenges that require legal attention.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2024, around 96% of deepfakes were pornographic (Twomey et al.). 
            This raises serious ethical questions, as the risks of reputational harm and exploitation are high. While the adult film industry could technically benefit 
            from this technology by creating media that attracts large audiences, the absence of consent makes its use deeply problematic. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Deepfakes also open the door to harmful activities such as revenge porn, harassment, and bullying. Furthermore, the political realm is at risk, as deepfakes 
            can be used to spread fake news and misinformation, which can mislead the public and manipulate political opinions.
        </p>

        <!-- Legal and ethical questions about extreme deepfake usage -->
        <p>
            Given the potential for harm, how should deepfake technology be regulated? One particularly troubling application is the creation of fake child pornography 
            using deepfake technology. For instance, someone could use deepfake to swap the face of an adult film star with that of a child or create entirely synthetic 
            images of a child performing sexual acts. Although no actual child is harmed in this process, the creation and distribution of such material raise significant 
            legal and ethical concerns. Should the person responsible face criminal charges? And how should the legal system address this issue?
        </p>
        
        <!-- Legislative action examples -->
        <p>
            Some states have already taken action to regulate deepfake technology. For example, New York State is considering the AI Child Safety Act, which aims to criminalize the 
            unlawful promotion or possession of digitally created child sexual performances. This bill seeks to increase penalties for those who engage in such behavior, potentially 
            elevating charges from a Class D or E felony to a Class C felony (NCSL). More states are likely to introduce similar legislation as the prevalence of deepfakes increases. 
            These efforts reflect a positive shift, as laws are evolving to protect individuals from the misuse of emerging technologies. Although laws are being enacted to prevent 
            impersonation of professionals, such as lawyers, doctors, or government officials, more targeted laws addressing various forms of deepfake media are crucial. It is hoped 
            that, over time, more states will develop laws that comprehensively address all aspects of deepfake technology.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Arguments for and against deepfake technology -->
        <p>
            Some argue that deepfake technology should be completely abolished due to its potential for harm. However, others contend that such a ban would be unethical, 
            given the technology’s scope, scale, and potential for positive uses (Westerlund). Deepfake technology can be harnessed for creative purposes, such as enriching 
            media and communication. While there are valid concerns regarding its misuse, there is also room for responsible use of this technology in entertainment, education, 
            and even medicine. The key is to ensure proper governance and regulation to mitigate the risks while allowing the technology to flourish in positive ways.
