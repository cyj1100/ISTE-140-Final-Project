        <!-- Description of a deepfake experiment -->
        <p>
            Edited picture of former president Barack Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Winston Smith published this media in 2010 as an 
            experiment to test the effects of this technology. At the time, about 40% of conservatives remembered it as a real event, while about 30% of liberals also 
            remembered it, showing signs of confirmation bias.

    <!-- Article section expanding on the example -->
    <article class="container article">
        <p>
            A notable social experiment conducted in 2010 involved a fake photo of former President Barack Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. 
            Despite the clear disclaimer that the image was not real, approximately 40% of conservatives and 30% of liberals remembered the event as though it had occurred.

            This demonstrates the power of visual media in shaping public perception, even when the content is fabricated. Deepfakes, therefore, pose a significant threat 
            to political stability and national security, as they could easily sway public opinion and undermine trust in political institutions. Additionally, deepfake 
            technology has the potential to be used in corporate sabotage, such as manipulating stock prices by fabricating scandalous actions involving a company’s CEO.

    <section class="quotes">
        <!-- Each quote is a slide for the bxSlider carousel -->
        <p class="slide">"An increase in the accessibility of deepfake video production would lead to an increase in the prevalence of deepfake videos online and thus lead 
        to increased damage to the value of real media in our information environment." - Twomey, John, et al.</p>

        <p class="slide">"Because deep learning technology is so sophisticated, many worry it can easily dupe the public into thinking fake audio and video are real. 
        Conversely, as fakes become more common, they may undermine trust in audiovisual material. Down we go into a post-truth, post-trust dystopia. That’s the fear, at least." - Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression</p>

        <p class="slide">"As social media sites and email became commonplace, lawmakers in at least 17 states enacted laws that specifically refer to online impersonation 
        done with an intent to intimidate, bully, threaten or harass a person through social media sites, email or other electronic or online communications." - National Conference of State Legislatures</p>
        
        <p class="slide">"There is a lack of work on the deepfake detection framework’s interpretability and dependability." - Akhtar, Zahid</p>
        
        <p class="slide">"The game-changing factor of deepfakes is the scope, scale, and sophistication of the technology involved, as almost anyone with a computer can fabricate fake videos that are practically indistinguishable from authentic media." - Westerlund, Mika</p>
