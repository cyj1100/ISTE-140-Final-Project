    <section class="container quote">
        <h2>
            "The game-changing factor of deepfakes is the scope, scale, and sophistication of the technology involved, as almost anyone with a computer can fabricate
            fake videos that are practically indistinguishable from authentic media."
        </h2>

        <h2>What are deepfakes?</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most fascinating developments in the realm of Artificial Intelligence is deepfake technology. This technology allows users to manipulate media 
            to create false, yet realistic, photos, videos, or audio recordings of individuals acting in any way they desire. 
        </p>

        <h2>What does the law have to do with it?</h2>
        <p>
            Deepfakes are increasingly being used and distributed online, with a range of ethical and legal implications. Surprisingly, the majority of deepfakes online 
            are pornographic in nature, and many are produced without consent. In fact, in 2024, around 96% of deepfakes were pornographic (Twomey et al.). 
        </p>
        <p>
            This raises serious ethical questions, as the risks of reputational harm and exploitation are high. While the adult film industry could technically benefit 
            from this technology by creating media that attracts large audiences, the absence of consent makes its use deeply problematic. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Deepfakes also open the door to harmful activities such as revenge porn, harassment, and bullying. Furthermore, the political realm is at risk, as deepfakes 
            can be used to spread fake news and misinformation, which can mislead the public and manipulate political opinions.

        <h2>For Example:</h2>
        <p>
            Edited picture of former president Barack Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Winston Smith published this media in 2010 as an 
            experiment to test the effects of this technology. At the time, about 40% of conservatives remembered it as a real event, while about 30% of liberals also 
            remembered it, showing signs of confirmation bias.
